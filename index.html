      <p>Hi guys, I am Wenxuan Xiong, and you can call me Daren.</p>
      <p>Most of time, I am not busy. So I did many Incomprehensible things.</p>
      <p>For example, at the park, I will be attracted by some boulders.</p>
      <p>
        While watching TV, I will be attracted by the scrolling advertisements
        at the top, and turn a blind eye to the contents.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the Grade 6, I made my group`s logo, “BBC”, B for Best, another B for
        Bear, C for Company.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the vacation, I made two classical games and made it open on the
        web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks my best friend in Beijing, he almost accompanied me throughout
        the vacation online.
      </p>
      <p>He called me “BenRheinz”.</p>
